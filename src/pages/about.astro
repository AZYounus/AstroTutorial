  <p>
    Hi I'm Zohra or Kallen! Truthfully there's too many names to list but those are my most common. 
    Or maybe you know the deadname. Regardless, you can think of me as a majestic frog or a parasite.

    I created this page to track whatever things take my fancy lately. I used to avoid the obsessions,
    but then I realized how sad life is without them. So, here's a gallery to my mind and hobbies.
    This is what I do instead of socializing and it is glorious.
